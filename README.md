# PIC-based-LED-Chaser-with-Multiple-Lighting-Effects
This project develops an LED chaser system using the PIC16F877A microcontroller (or similar PIC devices).
The system provides multiple LED lighting effects, including:

All LEDs ON/OFF.

Blinking mode.

Sequential lighting (left to right, right to left).

Inside-to-outside and outside-to-inside transitions.

Group-based alternate running lights.

Checkerboard pattern.

Users can switch between different display modes via a push button (PB0), and adjust the speed of LED transitions using another push button (PB1).
The design uses PORTA, PORTC, and PORTD as LED outputs, making it suitable for decorative lighting, demonstration purposes, and microcontroller training applications.
